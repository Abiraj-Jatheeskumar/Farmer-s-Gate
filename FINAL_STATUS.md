## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Redux State Management
- **authSlice**: Login, logout, profile updates
- **catalogSlice**: Products, categories, negotiations (with CRUD)
- **cartSlice**: Shopping cart with localStorage
- **ordersSlice**: Order management
- **usersSlice**: Sellers, agents, buyers (with status updates)
- **uiSlice**: Language, notifications

### CRUD Pattern (Used in All Dashboards)
```typescript
// CREATE
dispatch(addCategory(newCategory));

// READ
const categories = useAppSelector((state) => state.catalog.categories);

// UPDATE
dispatch(updateCategory(updatedCategory));

// DELETE
dispatch(deleteCategory(categoryId));
```
