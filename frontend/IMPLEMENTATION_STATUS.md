6. **UI Enhancements**
   - Breadcrumbs component
   - Empty states with illustrations

### Low Priority
7. **Utilities**
   - CSV export function for tables

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### TypeScript Errors
- Current TS errors in IDE are expected
- They occur because TypeScript can't infer Redux types until runtime
- Will resolve when app runs successfully

### Data Flow
1. All data starts from JSON files in `/src/data`
2. Loaded into Redux slices on app init
3. Components use `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch`
4. State persists via localStorage where needed

### Styling
- Maintained existing Poppins/Inter fonts
- Colors: Primary #2E7D32, Secondary #FFC107, Accent #0288D1
- Mobile-first responsive design
- shadcn/ui components throughout

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Complete Buyer Dashboard home page
2. Build Seller Dashboard with product management
3. Create Admin Dashboard with all CRUD operations
4. Implement Agent Dashboard
5. Add remaining routes to App.tsx
6. Test all features end-to-end
7. Fix any remaining bugs
